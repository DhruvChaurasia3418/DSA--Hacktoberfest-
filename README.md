## Tech Stack ‚ú®

We do not limit your knowledge. Hence we accept all programming languages. You should, however, write your code for a particular language in a that particular folder. In case a folder does not exist for a particular language, create one. Failing to do so will result in your pull request getting rejected.

If you are a beginner and do not know which language to get started with, C, C++, Java or Python is recommended. These are some standard languages to start your programming journey.
